    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>How to make the Kerisik (Coconut Paste)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To make the kerisik (toasted coconut), place the frozen desiccated coconut in a heated non-stick pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            While stirring continuously, toast coconut until golden brown, then transfer to a mortar or food processor.
            Pound or pulse until fine. Skip this step if your desiccated coconut is super fine. Set aside until ready to
            use.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to prepare the mushrooms</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Prepare the mushrooms – Clean mushrooms with a damp towel, then cut off the tough ends.
        </li>
        <li>
            If your mushroom is large enough, slice it in half, then tear each half into 2, so you'll have 4 parts.
            Repeat until you are done with all the mushrooms.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to make chili paste (sambal)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To make the chili paste, place all the rempah ingredients in a blender, then add enough oil (about 2
            tablespoons) to get the blender running. Blend or pulse the ingredients into a smooth paste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat a large non-stick pan, then add about 2-3 tablespoons of oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slowly pour in the chili paste and add in the green part of the lemongrass, and pandan leaves (if using).
            'Fry' the chili by stirring continuously over low-medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the chili paste until it turns darker or when you see some oil is starting to separate from the
            mixture.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to put everything together</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Add in the coconut milk and cook for another 30 seconds, then add in the mushrooms and cover the pan with a
            lid.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes or so until the mushrooms are fully cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with salt, sugar, and let it simmer for another minute or so.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, fold in the toasted coconut and lime leaves.</li>
        Discard the lemongrass stalk and pandan leaves before serving. Enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
