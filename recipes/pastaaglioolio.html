    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A super simple but incredibly tasy dish with just a couple of simple ingredients. Truly an Italian essential you
        simply cannot miss out on. Oh, did I forget to mention that it's completely vegan?</p>

    <p>This recipe was found on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/222000/spaghetti-aglio-e-olio/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Allrecipes.com</a></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Pound of uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>6 Garlic cloves, thinly slices</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup of olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (or to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup of chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        <li>(Optional) Vegan grated cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta
            bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine garlic and olive oil in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10
            minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden
            brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt into the pasta. Pour in olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on
            Italian parsley. Also mix in the vegan cheese if you're using it. Stir until combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve pasta, optionally topped with some extra vegan cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
